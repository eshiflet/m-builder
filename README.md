# Orbital Table

An interactive periodic table. Click an element to see its electrons and
orbitals in 3D.

## Run

ES modules need to be served over HTTP, so start any static server from this folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8742
```

Then open <http://localhost:8742>. Link to an element with a hash, such as `#Fe`.

## What you're looking at

- **Configurations** follow the Madelung (aufbau) rule, with the known exceptions
  (Cr, Cu, Pd, Au, the early actinides, and others) listed in `js/electron-config.js`.
- **Orbital shapes** are hydrogen-like wavefunctions (real spherical harmonics ×
  hydrogenic radial functions). They're scaled by an effective nuclear charge from
  Slater's rules, so relative sizes across shells are realistic but approximate.
- **Cloud** style draws points sampled from |ψ|². **Surface** style draws the
  isosurface that encloses ~85% of the probability (built with marching cubes).
- **Phase** coloring shows the sign of ψ, so lobes of opposite sign and radial
  nodes are visible.
- The **electron dots** hop between sampled positions. They show where an
  electron might be found, not a trajectory.

## Controls

- Drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, press **F** to refit the view.
- Press **← / →** to step through the elements.
- Click a subshell or orbital box in the panel to hide or show it, and hover
  over it to highlight it.
